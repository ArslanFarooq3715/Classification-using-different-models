# Neural Networks and Deep Learning for Classification problem

## Overview

This repository contains educational resources and practical implementations focused on neural networks and deep learning. It includes presentation slides that explain the foundational concepts of deep learning, as well as Jupyter notebooks demonstrating hands-on applications using various datasets for classification tasks.

## Contents

- **Slides**: Presentation materials covering the principles of neural networks and deep learning, including architecture, activation functions, training processes, and practical applications.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - **neural_networks_1_hidden_layer.ipynb**: This notebook explores the classification of a dataset containing images of cats and mixed breeds using a neural network with a single hidden layer. It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model.
  - **Logistic Regression Tutorial.ipynb**: This notebook provides a detailed tutorial on logistic regression, applied to a dog dataset. It covers the fundamentals of logistic regression, including its mathematical foundation and implementation, with an emphasis on achieving a deeper understanding of classification techniques.

## Datasets

1. **Cats and Mixed Dataset**: Used for classification in the neural network notebook, this dataset contains labeled images of cats and mixed breed dogs, enabling the exploration of deep learning techniques for image classification.
  
2. **Dog Dataset**: Utilized in the logistic regression tutorial, this dataset is designed to illustrate the principles of logistic regression in a binary classification scenario.
